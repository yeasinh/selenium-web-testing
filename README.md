# Web UI Automation Testing using Selenium WebDriver

I've followed some online tutorials on Selenium.
The scripts are written in Java and Eclipse has been used as the IDE.

The Bug Res and Swag Labs projects are built as a Maven project.
The other projects are built as Java projects.

Before starting any project, make sure to follow the following steps:
1. Install the Java SDK from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/).
2. Install the Eclipse IDE from [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).

For Maven projects, the following dependencies have been added from the [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/):
1. Selenium Java
2. WebDriverManager
3. TestNG

To add the dependencies, just copy the codes from the website and paste them into the pom.xml file inside the dependencies tag.

For the Java projects, follow the following steps:
1. Install the Selenium WebDriver for Java Client Driver from [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/).
2. Configure Eclipse with WebDriver.

To configure Eclipse with WebDriver, add the external JARs to the ClassPath of your project.
